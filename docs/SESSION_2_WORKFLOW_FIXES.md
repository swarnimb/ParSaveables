# Session 2: Workflow Fixes and Tournament Support

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Focus:** Fix workflow execution issues, enable tournament support, improve dashboard

---

## Summary

Successfully fixed critical workflow issues that prevented tournament detection and caused duplicate round saves. Implemented database-driven configuration loading and tested with both season and tournament scorecards.

---

## Major Changes

###  1. Fixed Parallel Branch Execution Issue

**Problem:** Find Tournament and Find Season nodes running in parallel caused:
- Duplicate workflow executions
- Unreliable node execution
- Duplicate rounds saved to database

**Solution:** Consolidated into sequential flow
- **Before:**
  ```
  Format Date for Query → Find Tournament ↘
                       → Find Season    ↗ → Select Best Event → ...
  ```
- **After:**
  ```
  Format Date for Query → Find Event (Supabase) → Select Best Event (Code) → ...
  ```

**Files Changed:**
- Modified `select-best-event.js` to work with single Find Event node
- Find Event uses Supabase node with date range filters
- Select Best Event prioritizes tournaments over seasons

---

### 2. Fixed Tournament Detection

**Problem:** Scorecards from Sept 25-29 (Portlandia 2025) were being classified as Season 2025

**Root Cause:** Parallel branch execution + no tournament prioritization logic

**Solution:**
- Single Find Event Supabase node queries events matching date range
- Select Best Event Code node sorts results (tournament > season)
- Tournament scorecards now correctly routed to Portlandia 2025

**Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE $date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
  AND is_active = true
```

---

### 3. Implemented Configuration-Driven Load Configuration

**Problem:** HTTP Request nodes and fetch() calls failing in n8n Code nodes

**Solution:** Sequential Supabase node flow
- Fetch Courses (Supabase) → 20 courses with tiers/multipliers
- Pass Event Data (Set) → Combines event + courses data
- Fetch Points System (Supabase) → Points system config by ID
- Load Configuration (Code) → Combines all data + round data

**Files:**
- `load-configuration-final.js` - Final working version
- Uses `.first().json` instead of `.item.json` to avoid paired item errors
- Fetches round data from "Format Date for Query" node

---

### 4. Updated Calculate Points for New Flow

**Problem:** Calculate Points couldn't access data after workflow restructure

**Solution:**
- Get all data from Load Configuration output
- Reference "Format Date for Query" directly for round data
- Removed references to non-existent nodes

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD: const event = $('Select Best Event').item.json;
// NEW: const config = $('Load Configuration').item.json;
//      const event = config.event;
```

---

### 5. Dashboard Cosmetic Improvements

**Changes:**
1. **Tournament Table:** Removed "Total" column from Scores by Rounds
2. **Monthly Trend:** Changed from per-month points to cumulative totals
3. **Chart Colors:** Updated to more distinct color palette

**File:** `ParSaveablesDashboard/index.html`

**New Colors:**
- Red (#FF6384), Blue (#36A2EB), Yellow (#FFCE56)
- Green (#4BC0C0), Purple (#9966FF), Orange (#FF9F40)
- Pink (#FF6384), Teal (#4DC9F6), Lime (#8BC34A), Indigo (#7C4DFF)

---

## Database Changes

### New File: `clean_courses.sql`

Corrected course list with 20 courses (removed duplicates/alternates):

**Tier 1 (3):** Wells Branch, Lil G, Armadillo Mini
**Tier 2 (3):** Zilker Park, Live Oak, Bartholomew Park
**Tier 3 (8):** Northtown Park, Searight Park, MetCenter, Old Settler's, Cat Hollow, Circle C, Frisbee Fling, Williamson County
**Tier 4 (6):** East Metro, Sprinkle Valley, Roy G Guerrero, Bible Ridge, Flying Armadillo, Harvey Penick

## Testing Results

### ✅ Season Scorecard Test
- Date: Oct 18, 2025
- Event: Season 2025
- Course: Sprinkle Valley (Tier 4, 2.5x multiplier)
- Result: ✅ Correct event, correct multiplier applied

### ✅ Tournament Scorecard Test
- Date: Sept 26, 2025
- Event: Portlandia 2025 (tournament)
- Course: Various
- Result: ✅ Correct tournament detection, no multiplier (1.0x)

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
- **Before:** 2 rounds saved per scorecard
- **After:** 1 round saved per scorecard

---

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Parallel branch execution** - Eliminated parallel paths
2. ✅ **Tournament vs Season detection** - Proper prioritization logic
3. ✅ **HTTP/fetch() errors** - Used Supabase nodes instead
4. ✅ **Paired item errors** - Used `.first()` instead of `.item`
5. ✅ **Duplicate rounds** - Single execution path
6. ✅ **Node name typo** - "Format Date for Query" (not "Format Data")

---

## Critical Learnings

### n8n Workflow Best Practices
1. **Avoid parallel branches** - Use sequential flows when possible
2. **Node name precision** - `$('Node Name')` must match exactly
3. **Use Supabase nodes** - Don't use fetch() in Code nodes
4. **Data pairing** - Use `.first()` or `.all()` instead of `.item` across workflow restructures
5. **Pass data forward** - Don't rely on distant node references

### Points System Flexibility
- **Season:** Rank points + performance × course multiplier
- **Tournament:** Rank points + performance × 1.0 (no multiplier)
- All rules stored in database `points_systems` table

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test with more Portlandia scorecards
2. ⏳ Process 5 Portlandia tournament scorecards
3. ⏳ Monitor for any remaining duplicate issues
4. ⏳ Consider consolidating Find Event + Select Best Event into one SQL query (future optimization)
