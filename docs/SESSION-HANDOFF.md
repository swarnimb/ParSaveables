## System Architecture Overview

### Backend (Serverless - Vercel)
**8 Microservices:**
1. `emailService.js` - Gmail API integration
2. `visionService.js` - Claude Vision API for scorecard extraction
3. `scoringService.js` - Stats calculation and ranking
4. `eventService.js` - Event assignment (season/tournament)
5. `playerService.js` - Player validation with fuzzy matching
6. `configService.js` - Configuration loader
7. `pointsService.js` - Points calculation
8. `databaseService.js` - Supabase CRUD operations

**2 API Endpoints:**
- `/api/processScorecard` - Main workflow orchestrator
- `/api/chatbot` - AI chatbot for dashboard queries

### Frontend (Static HTML/CSS/JS)
**Mobile Dashboard (Nov 2025):**
- `public/dashboard/index.html` - Landing page + dashboard shell (~105 lines)
- `public/dashboard/style.css` - Complete styling with CSS variables (~1404 lines)
- `public/dashboard/app.js` - Main orchestrator, routing, state, charts (~1129 lines)
- `public/dashboard/components.js` - Reusable UI components (~284 lines)
- `public/dashboard/data.js` - Supabase queries + chart data fetching (~242 lines)
- `public/dashboard/forest-bg.jpg` - Background image

**Features:**
- Landing page: Funny description + 4 vertical tabs with morph animation
- Leaderboard tab: Podium (top 3), leaderboard (all players), expandable stats
- Stats tab: 3 swipeable charts with touch gestures, event-aware
- Podcast tab: Placeholder for future podcast feature
- Rules tab: Points system info with top-10 rule for seasons

**Legacy Dashboards:**
- `public/index.html` - Old desktop dashboard (~2700 lines, deprecated)
- `public/admin.html` - Admin panel (~1500 lines, still in use)

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
**Configuration Tables:**
- `events` - Seasons and tournaments with player lists
- `points_systems` - Scoring rules (JSONB config)
- `courses` - 20 canonical courses with tier/multiplier
- `course_aliases` - Alternate spellings mapped to canonical courses
- `registered_players` - Player registry

**Data Tables:**
- `rounds` - Round metadata (references canonical course names)
- `player_rounds` - Player stats and points

---

## Key Technical Details

### Event-Based Player Filtering
- Each event has a `players` column (JSONB array)
- Dashboard loads `currentEventPlayers` from selected event
- Only players in that list appear on leaderboard
- Example: 2025 season excludes Food Zaddy and ScarletSpeedster

### Points Calculation
- Configured per event via `points_system_id`
- Rank points + performance bonuses (birdies/eagles/aces)
- Course multipliers applied (frozen at insert time)
- Tied ranks get averaged points

### Player Validation (Fuzzy Matching)
- Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm
- 95% threshold for exact match
- 75% threshold for fuzzy match
- Skips emoji-only names (like Bird 🦅)

### Vision API Rules
- Detects bird emoji → assigns "Bird" as player name
- Minimum 4 players required
- Extracts hole-by-hole scores, stats, course, date

### Course Matching (Aliases System)
- Database function `find_course_by_name_or_alias()` handles variations
- 3-level fallback: exact match → alias match → partial match
- Vision service can extract any spelling (e.g., "Flying Armadillo DGC - Big Course")
- Aliases automatically map to canonical course (e.g., "Armadillo Big")
- **20 canonical courses** (clean table, no duplicates)
- **17+ aliases** for scorecard variations
- All historical rounds updated to reference canonical names

## Common Tasks & How to Do Them

### Add New Registered Player
**Database:**
```sql
INSERT INTO registered_players (player_name, active)
VALUES ('Player Name', true);
```
**Also update:** `public/index.html` REGISTERED_PLAYERS array (line ~1083)

### Remove Player from Event
```sql
UPDATE events
SET players = players - 'Player Name'
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Populate Event Players from Data
```sql
UPDATE events
SET players = (
  SELECT jsonb_agg(DISTINCT player_name ORDER BY player_name)
  FROM player_rounds
  WHERE event_id = X
)
WHERE id = X;
```

### Add New Course Alias
When vision service extracts a new course name variation:
```sql
-- Add alias to existing canonical course
INSERT INTO course_aliases (alias, course_id)
SELECT 'New Course Name Variation', id
FROM courses
WHERE course_name = 'Canonical Course Name'
ON CONFLICT (alias) DO NOTHING;
```

### Add New Course (Entirely New)
```sql
-- Insert new canonical course
INSERT INTO courses (course_name, tier, multiplier)
VALUES ('New Course Name', 2, 1.5);
```

### Trigger Scorecard Processing
1. Visit https://par-saveables.vercel.app
2. Click "📧 Process Scorecards" button (top center)
3. Wait for processing (shows alert with results)

### Deploy Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Description"
git push
# Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
```

## Known Issues & Quirks

### Database Schema
- `rounds.season` column exists but is inconsistent (NULL for most)
- Use `event_id` instead - it's the source of truth
- See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for planned schema improvements

### Frontend Code
- Single large HTML files with inline styles/scripts
- Hard to maintain, needs modularization
- See ROADMAP for planned UI overhaul

### Chatbot
- Basic functionality works but needs enhancement
- Limited query types supported
- See ROADMAP for improvement plan

### Podcast Feature
- Partially implemented
- Works but needs refinement
- See ROADMAP for enhancement plan

---

## Upcoming Work (Priority Order)

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for full details. Top priorities:

1. **Chatbot Enhancement** (High)
   - Better AI responses
   - More query types
   - Conversation history

2. **Dashboard & Admin UI Overhaul** (High)
   - Modularize code (separate CSS/JS files)
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Better visual design

3. **Registered Players Management** (Medium)
   - Add CRUD interface to admin panel
   - Currently only manageable via SQL
